In this study, radioligand therapy is a radioactive drug called 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1. It works by binding to PSMA-expressing prostate tumor cells and delivering the radioactive portion of the drug directly to the tumor cells while not harming normal cells. Radiation therapy such as external beam radiotherapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving radioligand therapy with PSMA PET-guided external beam radiotherapy may kill more tumor cells in post-prostatectomy patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Demonstrate the safety and feasibility of treating radiotherapy (RT) prostate cancer patients via addition of lutetium Lu 177 PSMA-10.1 (177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1) in a selected post-prostatectomy population.\n\nII. Analyze dosimetry of radioligand therapy (RLT) after each cycle of 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Determine the feasibility of and develop preliminary data in the correlation of circulating tumor circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) at baseline, after RT, and RLT.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1.\n\nPatients undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) followed by 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 intravenously (IV) on study. Patients also receive flotufolastat F-18 (rhPSMA-7.3) IV with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) at screening and undergo single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-CT and collection of blood samples on study.\n\nPatients follow up 6 weeks after the last 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 administration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Carcinoma","Prostate Adenocarcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (EBRT, 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients undergo EBRT followed by 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 IV on study.
