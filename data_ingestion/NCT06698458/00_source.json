The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of Alpha DaRT in combination with chemotherapy, based on the cumulative incidence rate, severity and outcome of device related AEs. Classification of AEs will be done according to CTCAE V5. The secondary objectives of the study are to:\n\n* Assess efficacy of the Alpha DaRT sources in combination with chemotherapy, determined by overall and progression-free survival.\n* Assess pain control\n* Assess rate of surgical resection in Cohort 1.","detailedDescription":"This study will be a prospective, interventional, open label, two cohort, multiple center study to assess the efficacy of Alpha DaRT in combination with chemotherapy. Eligible patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer will be categorized into one of the following two cohorts according to their disease state at baseline:\n\n1. Locally advanced\n2. Metastatic. Patients will begin mFOLFIRINOX treatment and will undergo DaRT placement during the first 4 cycles. Follow-up will continue up to 6 months after enrollment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Pancreatic Cancer","Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma","Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer"],"keywords":["Alpha radiation","pancreatic cancer","Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma","Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"15 patients in each cohort for a total of 30 subjects.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients will begin mFOLFIRINOX treatment and will undergo DaRT placement during the first 4 cycles.

to sign an informed consent form\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will have evidence of negative pregnancy test before the Ra-224 implantation and are required to use an acceptable contraceptive method to prevent pregnancy for 3 months after initiation of Alpha DaRT therapy.\n* Patients must agree to use adequate contraception (vasectomy or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 3 months after DaRT insertion.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* For Cohort 1 only: Borderline unresectable pancreatic cancer, and/or fit for surgical exploration unless patient refuses surgery.\n* For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2: Prior treatment for pancreatic cancer, including chemotherapy except for 1 - 4 cycles of mFOLFIRINOX, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, etc.\n* Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the treatment.\n* Patients undergoing systemic immunosuppressive therapy excepting intermittent, brief use of systemic corticosteroids.\n* Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, e.g. cardiac failure of New York Heart Association classes III-IV, uncontrolled coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, uncontrolled arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, or history of myocardial infarction in the last 12 months.\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses including, but not limited to an active infection requiring systemic therapy or a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder(s) that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial or interfere with the study endpoints.\n* Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.\n\nExceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, low risk prostate cancer, or in situ cervical cancer.\n\n* Patient requires treatment not specified in this protocol which may conflict with the endpoints of
