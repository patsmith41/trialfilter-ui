Proton beam radiation therapy uses a beam of protons (rather than x-rays) to send radiation inside the body to the tumor without damaging much of the healthy tissue around it. Intensity modulated photon radiotherapy uses high-energy x-rays to deliver radiation directly to the tumor without damaging much of the healthy tissue around it. It is not yet known whether proton beam therapy or intensity modulated photon radiotherapy will work better in treating patients with esophageal cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine if overall survival (OS) is improved with proton beam radiation therapy (PBT) treatment as compared to intensity modulated photon radiation therapy (IMRT) as part of planned protocol treatment for patients with esophageal cancer.\n\nII. To determine if OS with PBT is non-inferior to IMRT as part of planned protocol treatment and that there will be less grade 3+ cardiopulmonary toxicity with PBT than with IMRT.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the symptom burden and impact on functioning of patients between treatment modalities based on Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures of symptoms using MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Fatigue.\n\nII. To compare the Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) using EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ5D) as a health outcome between PBT and IMRT, if the protocol primary endpoint is met.\n\nIII. To assess the pathologic response rate between PBT and IMRT. IV. To assess the cost-benefit economic analysis of treatment between radiation modalities.\n\nV. To compare the length of hospitalization after protocol surgery between PBT and IMRT.\n\nVI. To compare the incidence of grade 4 lymphopenia during chemoradiation between PBT and IMRT.\n\nVII. To compare lymphocyte nadir at first follow-up visit after completion of chemoradiation between PBT \\& IMRT.\n\nVIII. To estimate the locoregional failure, distant metastatic free survival, and progression-free survival of patients treated with PBT versus IMRT.\n\nIX. To compare incidence of both early (\\< 90 days from treatment start) and late (≥ 90 days from treatment start) cardiovascular and pulmonary events between PBT versus IMRT.\n\nX. To compare the Total Toxicity Burden (TTB) of IMRT versus PBT based on a composite index of 9 individual cardiopulmonary toxicities.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To collect biospecimens for future analyses, for example to assess cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers in association with treatment complications.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients undergo PBT over 28 fractions 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) and carboplatin IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 while undergoing PBT.\n\nGROUP II: Patients undergo IMRT over 28 fractions 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV and carboplatin IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 while undergoing IMRT.\n\nIn both groups, within 4-8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, patients may undergo an esophagectomy per physician discretion.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years and then annually thereafter."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Clinical Stage I Esophageal Adenocarcinoma AJCC v8","Clinical Stage I Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma AJCC v8","Clinical Stage I Gastroesophageal
