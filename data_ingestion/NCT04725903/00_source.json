Proton beam therapy is a new type of radiotherapy that directs multiple beams of protons (positively charged subatomic particles) at the tumor target, where they deposit the bulk of their energy with essentially no residual radiation beyond the tumor. By reducing the exposure of the healthy tissues and organs to radiation in the treatment of prostate cancer, proton therapy has the potential to better spare healthy tissue and reduce the side effects of radiation therapy.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the rate of acute grade 2+ gastrointestinal toxicity compared to historical photon treatments.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the rate of acute grade 2+ genitourinary toxicity compared to historical photon treatments.\n\nII. To assess the feasibility of extended-field proton irradiation of high-risk prostate.\n\nIII. To demonstrate safety of proton therapy followed by high dose rate (HDR) boost.\n\nIV. To determine patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of toxicity.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo conventionally fractionated proton beam therapy daily on Monday-Friday. Patients may receive a high-dose rate brachytherapy boost.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stage III Prostate Cancer AJCC V8","Stage IIIA Prostate Cancer AJCC V8","Stage IIIB Prostate Cancer AJCC V8","Stage IIIC Prostate Cancer AJCC V8"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":30,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (proton beam therapy)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients undergo conventionally fractionated or hypofractionated proton beam therapy daily on Monday-Friday directed to the prostate, pelvic lymph nodes, and para-aortic lymph nodes.
