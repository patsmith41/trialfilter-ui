Radiation therapy uses high energy radiation or protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Cisplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Carboplatin is also in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving pembrolizumab alone after surgery may work better than the usual approach in shrinking recurrent or primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate overall survival (OS) of adjuvant pembrolizumab for 12 months compared to adjuvant reirradiation plus concurrent platinum chemotherapy in high risk head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the following endpoints in both arms: disease free survival (DFS), locoregional control, rates of distant metastasis, toxicity.\n\nII. To evaluate whether high PD-L1 expression (defined as Combined Positive Score \\[CPS\\] \\>= 20) is predictive of increased efficacy in the experimental group compared to control.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM B: Patients receive cisplatin or carboplatin intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 7 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) once daily (QD) for a total of 30 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM C: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 9 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients in all arms undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years from the date of registration."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":188,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm B (cisplatin, carboplatin, IMRT, PBRT)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients receive cisplatin or carboplatin IV on day 1.
