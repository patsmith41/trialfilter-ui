Radiation therapy, such as photon therapy, uses high energy x-rays to send the radiation inside the body to the tumor while proton therapy uses a beam of proton particles. Proton therapy can stop shortly after penetrating through the tumor and may cause less damage to the surrounding healthy organs and result in better survival in patients with liver cancer.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if overall survival (OS) is different for hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with protons compared to photons.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the difference in progression-free-survival (PFS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with protons compared to patients with HCC treated with photons.\n\nII. To determine the difference in local progression (LP) in patients with HCC treated with protons compared to patients with HCC treated with photons.\n\nIII. To determine differences in toxicity in patients with HCC treated with protons versus photons.\n\nIV. To determine differences in fatigue, as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue in patients with HCC treated with protons, versus photons; as well as quality-adjusted survival, if the primary endpoint is met.\n\nV. To determine if there are correlations between the baseline values of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and outcomes (OS/PFS/fatigue).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine differences in overall quality of life, measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary Cancer (FACT-Hep) in patients with HCC treated with protons.\n\nII. Biospecimen collection for future correlative science projects.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo proton therapy over 15-24 days for 5 or 15 fractions.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo photon therapy over 15-24 days for 5 or 15 fractions.\n\nPatients undergo computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly for up to 5 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma","Stage III Hepatocellular Carcinoma AJCC v7","Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":186,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm I (proton therapy)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients undergo proton therapy over 15-24 days for 5 or 15 fractions.
