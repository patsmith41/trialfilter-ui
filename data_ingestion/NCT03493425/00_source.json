Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, cisplatin, and carboplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy before surgery and radiation therapy may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed and treated with radiation.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the structure preservation rate for patients with locally advanced resectable nasal and paranasal sinus squamous cell carcinoma (NPNSCC) with or without neoadjuvant therapy; all patients will undergo surgical resection and postoperative standard care.\n\nII. Evaluate overall survival (OS) for patients with locally advanced resectable NPNSCC with or without neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection and postoperative standard care.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) for this patient population. II. Examine the rate of structure preservation for the orbit (freedom from orbital exenteration).\n\nIII. Evaluate site reported p16 data and correlate with outcome. IV. Determine the accuracy of baseline/post-chemotherapy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fludeoxyglucose F-18 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT)-based prediction of orbit and skull base preservation.\n\nV. Determine the accuracy of baseline/post-chemotherapy MRI and/or FDG PET/CT-based prediction of 2-year overall survival.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the effects of tobacco, operationalized as combustible tobacco (1a), other forms of tobacco (1b), and environmental tobacco exposure (ETS) (1c) on provider-reported cancer-treatment toxicity (adverse events \\[both clinical and hematologic\\] and dose modifications).\n\nII. To determine the effects of tobacco on patient-reported physical symptoms and psychological symptoms.\n\nIII. To examine quitting behaviors and behavioral counseling/support and cessation medication utilization.\n\nIV. To explore the effect of tobacco use and exposure on treatment duration, relative dose intensity, and therapeutic benefit.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients undergo standard of care surgery. Beginning 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients undergo image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD) for 5 fractions per week for 30 fractions. Patients with positive margins/positive extracapsular spread (ECS) in lymph nodes undergo image guided IMRT QD for 5 fractions per week for 30 fractions and cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes (for patients who are ineligible to receive cisplatin) weekly for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Patients who are ineligible to receive cisplatin receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of care surgery no later than 6 weeks following the last dose of chemotherapy. Beginning 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients undergo image guided IMRT QD for 5 fractions per week for 30 fractions. Patients with positive margins/positive ECS in lymph nodes undergo image guided IMRT QD for 5 fractions per week for 30 fractions and cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes (for patients who are ineligible to receive cisplatin) weekly for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months if \\< 2 years from study entry and then every 6 months if 2-5 years from study entry."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Stage III Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinus Squamous Cell Carcinoma AJCC v6 and v7","Stage IVA Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinus Squamous Cell Carcinoma AJCC v7"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":82,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A (surgery, IMRT, cisplatin, carboplatin)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients undergo standard of care surgery.
