      "briefSummary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of adding immunotherapy (brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab) to standard treatment (chemotherapy with or without radiation) to the standard treatment alone in improving survival in patients with stage I and II classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin is in a class of medications called antibody-drug conjugates. It is made of a monoclonal antibody called brentuximab that is linked to a cytotoxic agent called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30 positive lymphoma cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine sulfate, dacarbazine, and procarbazine hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Vincristine is in a class of medications called vinca alkaloids. It works by stopping cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Adding immunotherapy to the standard treatment of chemotherapy with or without radiation may increase survival and/or fewer short-term or long-term side effects in patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma compared to the standard treatment alone.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of a standard chemotherapy approach versus an immunotherapy (IO) approach (brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab) in patients with newly diagnosed early stage classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who have a rapid early response (RER) as determined by position emission tomography post cycle 2 (PET2) after 2 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy.\n\nII. To compare the PFS of a standard chemotherapy approach versus an IO therapy approach (brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab) plus involved site radiation therapy (ISRT) in patients with newly diagnosed early stage cHL who have a slow early response (SER) as determined by PET2 after 2 cycles of ABVD chemotherapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.

To evaluate the overall survival (OS) at 12 years of IO therapy versus standard therapy in early stage cHL patients who have a SER as determined by PET2 after 2 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy.\n\nIII. To demonstrate non-inferiority of overall survival (OS) at 12 years of IO therapy versus standard therapy in early stage cHL patients.\n\nIV. To evaluate in patients with newly diagnosed early stage cHL the PFS of a standard chemotherapy approach versus an IO therapy approach (brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab) in the overall cohort, in the favorable risk cohort, and in the unfavorable risk cohort.\n\nV. To evaluate the event-free survival (EFS) at 12 years of patients undergoing standard chemotherapy versus an IO therapy approach (brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab).\n\nVI. To compare the physician-reported treatment-related adverse event (AE) rates between a standard chemotherapy approach and an IO therapy approach (brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab) in patients with newly diagnosed early stage cHL.\n\nVII. To compare patient-reported adverse events using pediatric and adult versions of Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), stratified by age groups, therapeutic arms, and receipt of radiation therapy (RT) over time.\n\nVIII. To evaluate changes in patient-reported fatigue, cognitive functioning, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), e.g., emotional, physical, and role functioning, by treatment arm, using validated adult and pediatric measurement systems.\n\nIX. To evaluate self-reported late morbidities (e.g., cardiovascular, pulmonary and endocrine) over time for children, adolescents and adults undergoing standard chemotherapy versus an IO therapy approach (brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab) with and without RT using measures from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE).\n\nX. To evaluate fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-position emission tomography (PET) measurements of metabolic tumor burden (MTV and total lesion glycolysis \\[TLG\\]) at PET at baseline (PET1) as a predictive marker of PFS.\n\nXI. To evaluate the associations between race/ethnicity and key outcomes including early response to therapy, PFS and OS.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the PFS of a standard chemotherapy approach versus an IO therapy approach (brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab) in patients with newly diagnosed early stage cHL across different age groups (ages 5-11 years, 12-21 years, 22-39 years, 40-60 years).\n\nII. To bank specimens for future correlative studies. III. To assess concordance and discordance of rapid central review and local institutional review of FDG PET 5-point score (5-PS; previously referred to as Deauville score) at baseline PET1, interim PET2 and end of systemic therapy PET-end of systemic therapy (EST) SER.\n\nIV. To assess the association between PFS and the quantitative FDG-PET/computed tomography (CT) parameters (PET MTV, TLG, delta-standardized uptake value \\[SUV\\] and PET SUV-based quantitative surrogates \\[qPET\\] of visual qualitative 5-PS) on measurements by automated measurements using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) through artificial-intelligence (AI) machine learning in the entire population.\n\nV. To assess the agreement between quantitative FDG-PET/CT parameters obtained using AI and those based on measurements by a trained imaging physician.\n\nVI. To compare patient-reported adverse events (via pediatric \\[Ped\\]-PRO-CTCAE and PRO-CTCAE) to provider adverse event reporting.\n\nVII. To evaluate the association between self-reported race/ethnicity and social determinants of health.\n\nVIII. To evaluate the associations between race/ethnicity and post-progression/post-relapse overall survival.\n\nIX. To evaluate the completion rates of PRO and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) contact forms at 1 year off treatment for the first 450 eligible patients.\n\nX. To collect contact information from participants for future re-contact.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are stratified by risk status (favorable versus unfavorable) and then all patients receive the ABVD regimen (doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously \\[IV\\] over 3-15 minutes, bleomycin sulfate IV over at least 10 minutes, vinblastine sulfate IV, and dacarbazine IV over 15-60 minutes) on days 1 and 15 of each treatment cycle.

Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo FDG-PET/CT or MRI and are identified as RER or SER. Patients then receive treatment and imaging, and may undergo blood sample collection as in arm B.",
