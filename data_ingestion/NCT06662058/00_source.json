Cisplatin, a chemotherapy often used to treat head and neck cancers, and radiation given near the ear can cause hearing loss in some patients. Hearing loss can have a major negative impact on quality of life, contributing to social isolation and frustration. Identifying hearing changes may allow treatment changes to prevent further loss. Audiometry measures hearing loss using a graphic record of the softest sounds that a person can hear at various frequencies. It is recommended patients have a hearing test before, during and after treatment to monitor for any hearing loss. This is usually done in the office and performed on the same day as other visits whenever possible, however, patients who live far away or have stage IV cancer, may have more difficulty coming back for hearing tests. Offering close to home and remote audiometry may improve monitoring for hearing loss in patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer receiving cisplatin and/or radiation.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine whether a targeted intervention of remote audiometry offered to patients with advanced disease or living \\> 120 miles away increases overall participation in ototoxicity monitoring.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To estimate the incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).\n\nTERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To identify potential barriers to ototoxicity monitoring participation, from the patient perspective.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients undergo audiometry at Winship Emory Midtown (WEM) at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment.\n\nGROUP II: Patients who do not live \\> 120 miles away or do not have stage IV disease are assigned to Arm I. Patients who do live \\> 120 miles away or who have stage IV disease are assigned to Arm II.\n\nARM I (USUAL): Patients undergo audiometry at WEM at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment as in Group I.\n\nARM II (INTERVENTION): Patients undergo audiometry at WEM at baseline and are offered closer to home audiometry or self-administered remote audiometry at 3 and 12 months after chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Clinical Stage IV HPV-Mediated (p16-Positive) Oropharyngeal Carcinoma AJCC v8","Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck","Head and Neck Carcinoma of Unknown Primary","Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Metastatic Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck","Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Metastatic Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Metastatic Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Metastatic Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Metastatic Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Metastatic Paranasal Sinus Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Nasopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Paranasal Sinus Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck","Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Recurrent Paranasal Sinus Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Stage IV Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck AJCC v8","Stage IV Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma AJCC v8","Stage IV Laryngeal Cancer AJCC v8","Stage IV Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer AJCC v8","Stage IV Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma AJCC v8","Stage IV Oropharyngeal (p16-Negative) Carcinoma AJCC v8","Stage IV Sinonasal Cancer AJCC v8"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":118,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group I (audiometry)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients undergo audiometry at WEM at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Audiometric Test","Other: Interview"]},{"label":"Group II, Arm I (audiometry)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients undergo audiometry at WEM at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment as in Group I.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Audiometric Test","Other: Interview"]},{"label":"Group II, Arm II (close to home audiometry, remote audiometry)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients undergo audiometry at WEM at baseline and are offered closer to home audiometry or self-administered remote audiometry at 3 and 12 months after chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Audiometric Test","Other: Interview"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Audiometric Test","description":"Undergo audiometry","armGroupLabels":["Group I (audiometry)","Group II, Arm I (audiometry)","Group II, Arm II (close to home audiometry, remote audiometry)"],"otherNames":["Audiometric Testing","Audiometry","Hearing Test"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Audiometric Test","description":"Undergo close to home audiometry","armGroupLabels":["Group II, Arm II (close to home audiometry, remote audiometry)"],"otherNames":["Audiometric Testing","Audiometry","Hearing Test"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Audiometric Test","description":"Undergo self-administered remote audiometry","armGroupLabels":["Group II, Arm II (close to home audiometry, remote audiometry)"],"otherNames":["Audiometric Testing","Audiometry","Hearing Test"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Interview","description":"Ancillary studies","armGroupLabels":["Group I (audiometry)","Group II, Arm I (audiometry)","Group II, Arm II (close to home audiometry, remote audiometry)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Proportion of patients who complete at least one post-treatment audiogram","description":"The incidence of follow-up audiometry relative to the targeted intervention will be assessed using a Z test for the equality of two proportions.
