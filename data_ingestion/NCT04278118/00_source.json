Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells. A shorter duration of radiation treatment may avoid some of the delayed side effects of radiation while providing a more convenient treatment and reducing costs.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To report 3 year local tumor control of moderately hypofractionated proton or photon therapy for benign intracranial tumors.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To demonstrate feasibility of moderate hypofractionation pencil beam scanning proton therapy for intracranial tumors.\n\nII. To report physician reported acute and late toxicity of moderate hypofractionation pencil beam scanning proton therapy for intracranial tumors according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.\n\nIII. To report neurocognitive effects, health related quality of life, and patient reported toxicity for moderate hypofractionation pencil beam scanning proton therapy for intracranial tumors.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I: Patients with benign and radiographically diagnosed intracranial tumors undergo hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy daily, Monday-Friday over 17 fractions for 3.5-4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCOHORT II: Patients with pathologically confirmed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2-3 meningiomas undergo hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy daily, Monday-Friday over 20 fractions for 3.5-4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Grade I Meningioma","Grade II Meningioma","Grade III Meningioma","Intracranial Neoplasm","Nerve Sheath Neoplasm","Pituitary Gland Adenoma","Schwannoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":70,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cohort I (hypofractionated radiation therapy)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with benign and radiographically diagnosed intracranial tumors undergo hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy daily, Monday-Friday over 17 fractions for 3.5-4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.","interventionNames":["Radiation: Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy","Radiation: Photon Beam Radiation Therapy","Radiation: Proton Beam Radiation Therapy","Other: Quality-of-Life Assessment","Other: Questionnaire Administration"]},{"label":"Cohort II (hypofractionated radiation therapy)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with pathologically confirmed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2-3 meningiomas undergo hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy daily, Monday-Friday over 20 fractions for 3.5-4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.","interventionNames":["Radiation: Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy","Radiation: Photon Beam Radiation Therapy","Radiation: Proton Beam Radiation Therapy","Other: Quality-of-Life Assessment","Other: Questionnaire Administration"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy","description":"Undergo hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy","armGroupLabels":["Cohort I (hypofractionated radiation therapy)","Cohort II (hypofractionated radiation therapy)"],"otherNames":["Hypofractionated Radiotherapy","hypofractionation"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Photon Beam Radiation Therapy","description":"Undergo hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy","armGroupLabels":["Cohort I (hypofractionated radiation therapy)","Cohort II (hypofractionated radiation therapy)"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Proton Beam Radiation Therapy","description":"Undergo hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy","armGroupLabels":["Cohort I (hypofractionated radiation therapy)","Cohort II (hypofractionated radiation therapy)"],"otherNames":["PBRT","Proton Radiation Therapy","Radiation, Proton Beam"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Quality-of-Life Assessment","description":"Ancillary studies","armGroupLabels":["Cohort I (hypofractionated radiation therapy)","Cohort II (hypofractionated radiation therapy)"],"otherNames":["Quality of Life Assessment"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Questionnaire Administration","description":"Ancillary studies","armGroupLabels":["Cohort I (hypofractionated radiation therapy)","Cohort II (hypofractionated radiation therapy)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"local tumor control","description":"Will assess local tumor control rate.
