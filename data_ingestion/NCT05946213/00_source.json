      "briefSummary": "This phase III trial compares stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), (five treatments over two weeks using a higher dose per treatment) to usual radiation therapy (20 to 45 treatments over 4 to 9 weeks) for the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer. SBRT uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period of time. This trial is evaluating if shorter duration radiation prevents cancer from coming back as well as the usual radiation treatment.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare metastasis-free survival, determined using conventional imaging, between men with high-risk prostate cancer randomized to ultrahypofractionation (stereotactic body radiation therapy \\[SBRT\\]) to those randomized to moderate hypofractionation and conventional fractionation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare physician-reported toxicity as measured by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5 between treatment arms.\n\nII. To determine if ultrahypofractionation is non-inferior to moderate hypofractionation and conventional fractionation with respect to patient-reported urinary function (assessed by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite \\[EPIC\\]-26 urinary domains).\n\nIII. To determine if ultrahypofractionation is non-inferior to moderate hypofractionation and conventional fractionation with respect to patient-reported bowel function (assessed by EPIC-26 bowel domain).\n\nIV. To compare patient-reported fatigue (assessed by Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System \\[PROMIS\\]-Fatigue) between treatment arms.\n\nV. To compare patient-reported treatment burden (assessed by COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity \\[COST\\]) between treatment arms.\n\nVI. To compare failure-free survival between treatment arms. VII. To compare metastasis-free survival based on molecular imaging between treatment arms.\n\nVIII. To compare overall survival between treatment arms.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare patient-reported sexual function (assessed by EPIC-26 sexual domain) between treatment arms.\n\nII. To compare patient-reported quality of life (assessed by European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level Scale Questionnaire \\[EQ-5D-5L\\]) between treatment arms.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo SBRT for a total of 5 treatments over 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo bone scan and/or computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT during screening and CT and/or MRI on study. Additionally, patients may optionally undergo blood and urine sample collection on study.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo external beam radiation treatment (EBRT) for 20-45 treatments over 4 to 9 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo bone scan and/or CT, MRI, or PET/CT during screening and CT and/or MRI on study. Additionally, patients may optionally undergo blood and urine sample collection on study.\n\nPatients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years."
