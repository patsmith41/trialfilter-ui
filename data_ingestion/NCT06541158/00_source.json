It is estimated that 20-30% patients with cancer experience travel-related barriers for cancer care. This is a particular problem for patients with radiation therapy as these patients frequently receive multiple treatment cycles, which often require daily treatment for multiple weeks or months. Addressing travel barriers has been a prerequisite for cancer care as travel barriers negatively influence cancer treatment adherence and cancer care outcomes, such as survival and quality of life. The TRACT program may help reduce travel barriers and therefore promote health equity among patients with solid tumors receiving radiation therapy.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To work collaboratively with a Community Advisory Board (CAB, e.g., patients, caregivers, clinicians, and social workers) to refine a theory-driven TRACT program for solid tumor patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) with travel barriers.\n\nII. To evaluate the feasibility of the TRACT program for patients with solid tumors receiving RT with travel barriers.\n\nIII. To explore the efficacy of the TRACT program on RT adherence (canceling, delaying, missing, or terminating essential care) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (distress, financial toxicity, and quality of life \\[QOL\\]) compared to enhanced usual care (EUC, usual care + transportation awareness brief video with Patient Advocate Foundation \\[PAF\\] pamphlet).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nSTAGE I (CAB): Participants meet with the study research team to develop and refine the TRACT program.\n\nSTAGE II: Patients are randomized to 2 groups.\n\nGROUP I: Patients receive the TRACT program consisting: of 1) Screening of travel barriers; 2) Awareness of transportation obstacles and resources using videos, 3) Assistance with transportation resource application and utilization, and 4) Alignment of community resources to navigate individualized transportation support by the trained travel navigator for 3 months.\n\nGROUP II: Patients receive usual care with PAF pamphlet for 3 months.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 3 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Malignant Solid Neoplasm"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":76,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Stage I (CAB)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants meet with the study research team to develop and refine the TRACT program.","interventionNames":["Other: Discussion"]},{"label":"Stage II Group I (TRACT program)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive the TRACT program consisting: of 1) Screening of travel barriers; 2) Awareness of transportation obstacles and resources using videos, 3) Assistance with transportation resource application and utilization, and 4) Alignment of community resources to navigate individualized transportation support by the trained travel navigator for 3 months.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Health Promotion and Care","Other: Questionnaire Administration"]},{"label":"Stage II Group II (usual care, video, pamphlet)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients receive usual care with PAF pamphlet for 3 months.","interventionNames":["Other: Best Practice","Other: Educational Intervention","Other: Media Intervention","Other: Questionnaire Administration"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Best Practice","description":"Receive usual care","armGroupLabels":["Stage II Group II (usual care, video, pamphlet)"],"otherNames":["standard of care","standard therapy"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Discussion","description":"Participate in a CAB","armGroupLabels":["Stage I (CAB)"],"otherNames":["Discuss"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Educational Intervention","description":"Receive PAF pamphlet","armGroupLabels":["Stage II Group II (usual care, video, pamphlet)"],"otherNames":["Education for Intervention","Intervention by Education","Intervention through Education","Intervention, Educational"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Health Promotion and Care","description":"Receive the TRACT program","armGroupLabels":["Stage II Group I (TRACT program)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Media Intervention","description":"Receive transportation awareness brief video","armGroupLabels":["Stage II Group II (usual care, video, pamphlet)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Questionnaire Administration","description":"Ancillary studies","armGroupLabels":["Stage II Group I (TRACT program)","Stage II Group II (usual care, video, pamphlet)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Feasibility of screening patients for the Transportation for Cancer Care Navigation Tool (TRACT) program","description":"Will be assessed by response rates, time burden (minutes to complete the measure), and percent of positive screenings.
