      "briefSummary": "This phase III trial tests whether adding trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk (Herceptin Hylecta \\[TM\\]) or pertuzumab, trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-zzxf (Phesgo \\[TM\\]) to the usual chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) works to shrink tumors in patients with HER2 positive endometrial cancer. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies and forms of targeted therapy that attach to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab or pertuzumab attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Hyaluronidase is an endoglycosidase. It helps to keep pertuzumab and trastuzumab in the body longer, so that these medications will have a greater effect. Hyaluronidase also allows trastuzumab and trastuzumab/pertuzumab to be given by injection under the skin and shortens their administration time compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab alone. Paclitaxel is a taxane and in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Giving Herceptin Hylecta or Phesgo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin may shrink the tumor and prevent the cancer from coming back in patients with HER2 positive endometrial cancer.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy of trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk (HERCEPTIN HYLECTA) and pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf (PHESGO) in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin in patients with HER2 positive endometrial cancer.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy of trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk (HERCEPTIN HYLECTA) and pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf (PHESGO) in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin in patients with HER2 positive endometrial cancer.\n\nII. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with measurable disease.\n\nIII. To evaluate the duration of objective response in patients with measurable disease as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n\nIV. To determine the nature, frequency and degree of toxicity as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 5.0 for each treatment arm.\n\nV. To compare quality of life (QOL), as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Endometrial Trial Outcome Index (FACT-En-TOI), in the experimental versus control arms.\n\nVI. To compare patient-reported treatment-associated symptoms (diarrhea and rash) as measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) - CTCAE, patient-reported fatigue as measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Fatigue short form, and worry concerning side effects of treatment as measured by the item 'bothered by side effect', in the FACT-En TOI, respectively, in the experimental and control arms.\n\nVII. To assess the correlation of HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression and in situ hybridization (ISH) amplification with clinical outcome and response to HER2 targeted therapies.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To explore time to sustained deterioration in quality of life, as measured by a drop in the FACT-En-TOI by 6 or more points lasting for more than one PRO time point, in the experimental and control arms.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR) who still have measurable disease after completion of cycle 6 may receive 4 additional cycles of this treatment at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\nARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes, and trastuzumab/hyaluronidase-oysk subcutaneously (SC) over 2-5 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with SD or PR who still have measurable disease after completion of cycle 6 may receive 4 additional cycles of this treatment at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\nMAINTENANCE: Patients receive trastuzumab/hyaluronidase-oysk SC over 2-5 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with SD or PR may continue maintenance therapy for up to 3 years from the start of treatment.\n\nARM III: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes, and pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase-zzxf SC over 5-8 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with SD or PR who still have measurable disease after completion of cycle 6 may receive 4 additional cycles of this treatment at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\nMAINTENANCE: Patients receive pertuzumab/trastuzumab/ hyaluronidase-zzxf SC over 5 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for up to 1 year in absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with SD or PR may continue maintenance for up to 3 years from the start of treatment.\n\nPatients undergo echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) and computed tomography (CT) throughout the study. Additionally, patients may optionally undergo blood sample collection throughout the study, vaginal brachytherapy on study, and urine sample collection prior to treatment.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years."

      "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 stage IA-IVB, non-recurrent, chemotherapy (chemo)-naive, HER2-positive endometrial cancer. The following endometrial cancer types are eligible:\n\n  * Serous\n  * Other endometrial cancers (including clear cell, endometrioid, mixed epithelial, dedifferentiated/undifferentiated)\n  * Carcinosarcoma\n\n    * NOTE: Endometrial cancers that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) by IHC are not eligible\n* Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required. Submission of surgical pathology report (or endometrial biopsy pathology report in patients who never undergo hysterectomy) is required\n* Patients must be within 8 weeks of primary surgery (or endometrial biopsy in patients who never undergo hysterectomy) at the time of study registration\n* Patients may have measurable disease, non-measurable disease, or no measurable disease. In patients with measurable disease, lesions will be defined and monitored by RECIST v 1.1. Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be \\>= 10 mm when measured by CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lymph nodes must be \\>= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI\n* For patients with uterine-confined (stage I) disease, the tumor must be invasive into the myometrium. Any amount of myoinvasion is acceptable for eligibility. Patients with non-invasive disease, endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma alone, or disease confined to a polyp will be excluded\n* All patients must have tumors that are HER2 positive as defined by American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) 2018 Breast Cancer guidelines (https://documents.cap.org/documents/algorithim-evaluation-her2.pdf.) IHC and ISH testing will be done locally, at each participating institution and interpreted by local pathologists. In general HER2 positivity is defined as any of the following:\n\n  * 3+ immunohistochemistry (IHC),\n  * 2+ IHC with positive in situ hybridization (ISH) Alternatively, patients could be eligible if next generation sequencing (NGS) demonstrates HER2 (ERBB2) amplification. NGS testing can be performed through any designated labs as per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) MATCH/NCI Combo-MATCH trial (https://ecog-acrin.org/nci-match-eay131-designated-labs).\n\nPathology report showing results of institutional HER2 testing (or NGS testing results) must be submitted.\n\nSites must submit all results available (IHC, ISH, and NGS)\n\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2\n* Age \\>= 18\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000/mcl (within 14 days prior to registration)\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1,500/mcl (within 14 days prior to registration)\n* Creatinine =\\< 1.5 x institutional/laboratory upper limit of normal (ULN) or estimated Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\>= 50 mL/min using either the Cockcroft-Gault equation, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study, or as reported in the comprehensive metabolic panel/basic metabolic panel (eGFR) (within 14 days prior to registration)\n* Total serum bilirubin level =\\< 1.5 x ULN (patients with known Gilbert's disease who have bilirubin level =\\< 3 x ULN may be enrolled) (within 14 days prior to registration)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =\\< 3 x ULN (within 14 days prior to registration)\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months of registration are eligible for this trial\n* Although the uterus will have been removed in the vast majority of patients, for patients of child-bearing potential: negative urine or serum pregnancy test. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test is required. Patients will be considered of non-reproductive potential if they are either:\n\n  * Postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause; in women \\< 45 years of age, a high follicle stimulating hormone \\[FSH\\] level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient); OR\n  * Have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion at least 6 weeks prior to registration\n  * Have a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection must have an undetectable HBV viral load on suppressive therapy, if indicated\n* Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured.
