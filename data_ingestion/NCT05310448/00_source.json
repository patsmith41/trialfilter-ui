Optune is a wearable, portable, treatment that creates low-intensity, wave-like electric fields called tumor treating fields (TTFields), which interfere with cancer cell division. TTFields may prevent growth or decrease size of gliomas in patients","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of tumor treating fields in combination with standard of care radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with brainstem gliomas.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and tumor treating fields by assessing progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate, and overall survival (OS).\n\nTERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the effects of the tumor treating fields on neurocognitive function.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nBeginning after start of standard of care radiation therapy, patients wear the Optune device for at least 18 hours per day for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nDuring study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. After study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Glioma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (tumor treating fields)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After completion of standard of care radiation therapy, patients wear the Optune device for 18 hours per day for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.","interventionNames":["Device: Optune device"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Optune device","description":"Wear Optune device","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (tumor treating fields)"],"otherNames":["Alternating Electric Field Therapy","TTF","TTFields","Tumor Treating Fields Therapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Incidence of adverse events","description":"Adverse event rates will be summarized descriptively using frequencies and percentages in addition to a tolerability rate defined as composite of any dose-limiting toxicity.","timeFrame":"Up to 12 months after TTFields started"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Progression free survival (PFS)","description":"PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and a 95% confidence interval for median PFS will be estimated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley approach.","timeFrame":"From TTFields start to disease progression or death, assessed up to 36 months"},{"measure":"Overall response rate","description":"Evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.","timeFrame":"Up to 12 months after TTFields started"},{"measure":"Overall survival (OS)","description":"OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and a 95% confidence interval for median OS will be estimated using the Brookmeyer-Crowley approach.","timeFrame":"From TTFields start to death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\>= 18 years\n* Karnofsky performance status \\>= 70%\n* Life expectancy \\> 12 weeks as determined by the investigator\n* Diagnosis of glioma with at least partial involvement or invasion of thalamus, cerebral peduncles, midbrain, pons, or medulla. Confirmation of diagnosis by biopsy or maximal safe resection preferred. If multi-disciplinary tumor board recommend no benefit and likely harm of attempting biopsy then can establish consensus clinical diagnosis. If foregoing biopsy then tumor board will estimate tumor stage based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings.\n* Completion of all previous therapy (including surgery and radiotherapy) for the treatment of cancer \\>= 4 weeks before the start of study therapy.\n* Willingness and ability of the subject to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, protocolspecified laboratory tests, other study procedures, and study restrictions.\n* Evidence of a personally signed informed consent indicating that the subject is aware of the neoplastic nature of the disease and has been informed of the procedures to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential risks and discomforts, potential benefits, and other pertinent aspects of study participation.\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function, within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 of Temozolomide, as defined below:\n\nHematology:\n\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 9.0 g/dl (no transfusions allowed within 7 days of cycle 1 day 1 to meet entry criteria) (within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1 of temozolomide)\n* White blood cell (WBC) \\>= 2000/uL (after at least 7 days without growth factor support or transfusion) (within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1 of temozolomide)\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1,500/mcL (after at least 7 days without growth factor support or transfusion) (within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1 of temozolomide)\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000/mcL (no transfusions allowed within 7 days of cycle 1 day 1 to meet entry criteria) (within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1 of temozolomide)\n* Prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =\\< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1 of temozolomide)\n\nChemistry\n\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 2 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1 of temozolomide)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =\\< 3 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1 of temozolomide)\n* Serum creatinine =\\< 2 mg/dL (or glomerular filtration rate \\>= 40 mL/min) (within 28 days of cycle 1 day 1 of temozolomide)\n* The effects of combination therapy with tumor treating fields (TTF) and temozolomide on the developing human fetus are unknown.

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 12 months after completion of TTF and Temozolomide administration.

Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Jim Zhong, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"404-778-3473","email":"jzhong@emory.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Jim Zhong, MD","affiliation":"Emory University Hospital/Winship Cancer Institute","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Emory Proton Therapy Center","status":"NOT_YET_RECRUITING","city":"Atlanta","state":"Georgia","zip":"30308","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"India Green","role":"CONTACT","phone":"404-778-1738","email":"india.eunhye.green@emoryhealthcare.org"},{"name":"Jim Zhong, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":33.749,"lon":-84.38798}},{"facility":"Emory University/Winship Cancer Institute","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Atlanta","state":"Georgia","zip":"30322","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"India Green","role":"CONTACT","phone":"404-778-1738","email":"india.eunhye.green@emoryhealthcare.org"},{"name":"Jim Zhong, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":33.749,"lon":-84.38798}},{"facility":"Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital","status":"NOT_YET_RECRUITING","city":"Atlanta","state":"Georgia","zip":"30342","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"India Green","role":"CONTACT","phone":"404-778-1738","email":"india.eunhye.green@emoryhealthcare.org"},{"name":"Jim Zhong, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":33.749,"lon":-84.38798}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2025-10-31"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D005910","term":"Glioma"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D018302","term":"Neoplasms, Neuroepithelial"},{"id":"D017599","term":"Neuroectodermal Tumors"},{"id":"D009373","term":"Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal"},{"id":"D009370","term":"Neoplasms by Histologic Type"},{"id":"D009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D009375","term":"Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial"},{"id":"D009380","term":"Neoplasms, Nerve Tissue"}]}},"hasResults":false}
