      "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests whether ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) in combination with talazoparib works to shrink tumors in patients with solid tumors that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with treatment and that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Another aim of this study is to find out if, and how, patients' genes influence their response to this specific drug combination. For this part of the study, investigators will run tests using samples of patients' tumor tissue and blood that will be collected during the study. ZEN-3694 is an inhibitor of a family of proteins called the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET). It may prevent the growth of tumor cells that overproduce BET protein. Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Genes are pieces of the DNA code that individuals inherit from their parents. Some genes work to protect against cancer by correcting damage that can occur in the DNA when cells divide. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two examples of these types of genes, and they are called tumor-suppressor genes. For example, if a person has a mutation in a BRCA1/2 gene they have a greatly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer because their cells may no longer be able to completely repair damaged DNA. It is the accumulation of DNA damage which causes a cell to change into a cancerous cell. Other genes are also involved in this process, and these are called DNA damage repair genes. The KRAS mutation is a change in a protein in normal cells. Normally KRAS serves as an information hub for signals in the cell that lead to cell growth, but when there is a mutation in KRAS it signals too much and cells grow without being told to, which causes cancer. Combination therapy with ZEN-3694 and talazoparib may be effective at slowing or stopping tumor growth in patients with advanced cancer.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate clinical response to the combination of BET bromodomain inhibitor ZEN-3694 (ZEN003694 \\[ZEN-3694\\]) and talazoparib using objective response rate (ORR) = (complete response \\[CR\\] + partial response \\[PR\\]).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To confirm the safety and toxicity profile of the combination of ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) and talazoparib.\n\nII. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (stable disease \\[SD\\] \\> 6 months \\[m\\]+CR+PR) and progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nIII. To assess the pharmacodynamics of the combination of ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) and talazoparib using pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies.\n\nIV. To characterize pharmacodynamic changes of exploratory biomarkers to the combination of ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) and talazoparib in pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies.\n\nV. To assess putative predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to the combination of ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) and talazoparib.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ZEN-3694 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and talazoparib PO QD on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo diagnostic imaging, blood sample collection, and tumor biopsy throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 days after administration of the last dose of study drug and then every 3 months for up to 2 years."

Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids are excluded. Of note, patients who required a single dose of corticosteroids on days receiving radiation treatment do not require a 2-week washout. Follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy must show no evidence of progression and patient should be clinically stable for at least 1 month. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical stability\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial. However, patients with concurrent malignancy that is progressing or requiring active treatment are excluded\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be of class 2B or better\n* The effects of the combination ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) and talazoparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, and because BET inhibitor agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 7 months after. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately\n* Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 7 months after completion of study drug administration\n* Women of child-bearing potential MUST have a negative serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test unless prior tubal ligation (\\>/= 1 year before screening), total hysterectomy, or menopause (defined as 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea)\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) or talazoparib\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or P-gp, strong inhibitors of BCRP, sensitive substrates of CYP1A2, proton-pump-inhibitors (H2 antagonists are allowed), and herbal medications/preparations (vitamins are allowed) are ineligible. Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first dose of ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694). Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) is a BET inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694), breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to the first dose of study drug and women should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 1 month following the last dose of the study drug. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Patients who are involved in the planning and/or conduct of the study\n* Patients who are unable or unwilling to swallow pills\n* Active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics, or other uncontrolled intercurrent illness requiring hospitalization\n* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are factor Xa inhibitors (i.e., rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban otamixaban, letaxaban, eribaxaban) and factor IIa inhibitors (i.e., dabigatran).
