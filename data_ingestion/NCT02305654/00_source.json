It efficiently examines a series of questions that routinely arise in the sequencing of treatment. The study design has evolved from lengthy international consultation that has enabled us to build consensus over which questions arise from current knowledge and practice. It will enable potential randomisation for the majority of patients with inguinal lymph node metastases and will provide data to inform future clinical decisions.\n\nInPACT-neoadjuvant patients are stratified by disease burden as assessed by radiological criteria. Treatment options are then defined according to the disease burden strata. Treatment is allocated by randomisation. Patients may be allocated to one of three initial treatments:\n\nA. standard surgery (ILND); B. neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by standard surgery (ILND); or C. neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by standard surgery (ILND).\n\nAfter ILND, patients are defined as being at low or high risk of recurrence based on histological interpretation of the ILND specimen. Patients at high risk of relapse are eligible for InPACT-pelvis, where they are randomised to either:\n\nP. prophylactic PLND Q. no prophylactic PLND"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Penis, Usual Type"],"keywords":["Penis cancer","Chemotherapy","Chemoradiotherapy","Surgery","Phase III"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A - Standard Surgery (ILND)","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Part of randomisation 1.\n\nThe total treatment duration (Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection (ILND)) is estimated to be over 1 day for those patients allocated to Arm A - standard surgery.","interventionNames":["Procedure: ILND - Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection"]},{"label":"Arm B - neoadjuvant chemotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Part of randomisation 1.\n\nPatients will receive up to 4 cycles of Paclitaxel, Ifosfamide, and Cisplatin (TIP).\n\nAdministration on an outpatient basis:\n\nPaclitaxel 175 mg/m2, day 1, Ifosfamide 900 mg/m2, days 2-5, Cisplatin 15 mg/m2, days 1-5\n\nAdministration on an inpatient basis:\n\nPaclitaxel 175 mg/m2, day 1, Ifosfamide 1200 mg/m2, days 1-3, Cisplatin 25 mg/m2, days 1-3","interventionNames":["Drug: Paclitaxel","Drug: Ifosfamide","Drug: Cisplatin"]},{"label":"Arm C - neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Part of randomisation 1.\n\nRadiotherapy dose is 45Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks using 6-10 MV photons to all regions.\n\nConcurrent cisplatin 40mg/m2 will be given weekly, subject to GFR\\>45mls/min.","interventionNames":["Drug: Cisplatin","Radiation: Intensity modulated radiation treatment (IMRT)"]},{"label":"Arm P - prophylactic PLND","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Part of randomisation 2.\n\nProphylactic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) - The total treatment duration is estimated to be over 1 day.\n\nPatients who have NOT received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy will receive adjuvant chemoradiotherapy:\n\nCisplatin 40mg/m2 will be given weekly, subject to GFR\\>45mls/min.\n\nGroin: One or both groins may be boosted up to 54Gy in 25 fractions.
