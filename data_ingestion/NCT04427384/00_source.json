Data collected will include local control, overall survival, QOL, neurocognition, functional decline, and surgical and radiation associated AE's. Data will be collected at 1, 3, 6, 9,12, 18 and 24 months, then every 6 months through 5 years. RESULT: Data will be used to benchmark clinical outcomes of STaRT therapy and allow for comparisons to existing standard-of-care treatments. This will be the first observational registry study of R+STaRT, delivered by Cs-131 sources in permanently implanted resorbable collagen tile carriers. The outcome measures captured will allow for evaluation of the potential risks and benefits of this treatment approach for patients in a real-world setting."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Tumor, Recurrent","Brain Tumor","Brain Tumor, Primary","Brain Tumor - Metastatic","Brain Tumor, Adult: Glioblastoma","Brain Tumor, Adult Meningioma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"5 Years","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":600,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"GammaTile","description":"Patients who have received permanent implants of GammaTile radiation therapy immediately following brain tumor resection.","interventionNames":["Device: GammaTile"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"GammaTile","description":"Surgically Targeted Radiation Therapy","armGroupLabels":["GammaTile"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Surgical Bed-Recurrence Free Survival in Metastatic Tumor Subjects","description":"No contrast enhancement in the area of the surgical bed","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Surgical Bed-Recurrence Free Survival in Meningioma Tumor Subjects","description":"No contrast enhancement in the area of the surgical bed","timeFrame":"3 years"},{"measure":"Overall Survival in High Grade Glioma Subjects","description":"Median duration of survival of subjects following surgical resection of tumor","timeFrame":"9 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
