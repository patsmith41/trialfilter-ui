      "briefSummary": "This phase III trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) to see how well they work compared to MRI surveillance alone in treating patients with small cell lung cancer. MRI scans are used to monitor the possible spread of the cancer with an MRI machine over time. PCI is radiation therapy that is delivered to the brain in hopes of preventing spread of cancer into the brain. The use of brain MRI alone may reduce side effects of receiving PCI and prolong patients' lifespan. Monitoring with MRI scans alone (delaying radiation until the actual spread of the cancer) may be at least as good as the combination of PCI with MRI scans.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate whether overall survival (OS) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance alone is not inferior to MRI surveillance combined with prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare cognitive failure free survival (CFFS) rate up to 12 months after randomization between the arms.\n\nII. To compare brain-metastasis-free survival between the arms. III. To compare OS between the arms within the subgroups of patients with limited-stage and extensive-stage disease.\n\nIV. To compare cognitive failure free survival (CFFS) rates at the assessment times between the arms.\n\nV. To compare the cumulative incidence of cognitive failure with death as a competing risk between the arms.\n\nVI. To compare the frequency and severity of toxicities between the two arms.\n\nADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To collect blood for banking.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo conventional or hippocampal avoidance PCI over 20 minutes 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Patients also undergo MRI scan at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo MRI scan at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months."

In addition to routine contraceptive methods, \"effective contraception\" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation. However, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures\n* Patients who speak and understand English or French must agree to participate in cognitive function testing\n* Patient must be offered the opportunity to have specimens submitted for banking\n* Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines\n* As a part of the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN) randomization process the treating institution?s identity is provided in order to ensure that the current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been entered in the system",
