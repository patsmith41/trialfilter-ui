Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Giving peposertib in combination with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy may work better than other standard chemotherapy, hormonal, targeted, or immunotherapy medicines available in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of peposertib (M3814) in combination with hypofractionated radiation and avelumab in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of the combination of hypofractionated radiation, peposertib (M3814), and avelumab as compared to the combination of hypofractionated radiation and avelumab in patients with advanced/metastatic hepatobiliary tumors by objective response rate (ORR) in non-irradiated lesions. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of peposertib (M3814) in combination with avelumab. (Phase I) III. To determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of hypofractionated radiation, peposertib (M3814), and avelumab as compared to hypofractionated radiation and avelumab by measurement of disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), PFS outside the irradiated field, and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced/metastatic hepatobiliary tumors. (Phase II) IV. To determine if baseline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair defects inherent to some cholangiocarcinomas correlate with a more dramatic response to radiation compared to those without as measured by gamma H2AX, phosphorylated (p)NBS1 and pKAP1 immunofluorescence (IFA) with beta CATN segmentation assay. (Phase II) V. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of peposertib (M3814) and avelumab. (Phase II)\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.

To determine if baseline tumor mutation burden and pattern, and neoantigen burden correlate with response.\n\nIb. To determine if combination therapy results in changes in the immune landscape in both the tumor and the host that correlate with response.\n\nIc.

H2 blockers are allowed provided they are taken at least 2 hours after peposertib (M3814) dose\n* Patients receiving sorivudine or any chemically related analogues (such as brivudine) and not able to discontinue prior to starting peposertib (M3814) and avelumab are excluded\n* Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study because peposertib (M3814) and avelumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with peposertib (M3814) and avelumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with peposertib (M3814) and avelumab\n* Patients who have received live vaccination within 30 days before starting peposertib (M3814) and avelumab","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Kristen R Spencer","affiliation":"Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Duarte","state":"California","zip":"91010","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Site Public Contact","role":"CONTACT","phone":"800-826-4673","email":"becomingapatient@coh.org"},{"name":"Gagandeep Brar","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":34.13945,"lon":-117.97729}},{"facility":"UCI Health - Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Ambulatory Care","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Irvine","state":"California","zip":"92612","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Site Public Contact","role":"CONTACT","phone":"877-827-8839","email":"ucstudy@uci.edu"},{"name":"Farshid Dayyani","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":33.66946,"lon":-117.82311}},{"facility":"UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"La Jolla","state":"California","zip":"92093","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Site Public Contact","role":"CONTACT","phone":"858-822-5354","email":"cancercto@ucsd.edu"},{"name":"Adam M.
