      "briefSummary": "This phase III trial compares total ablative therapy and usual systemic therapy to usual systemic therapy alone in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to up to 4 body sites (limited metastatic). The usual approach for patients who are not participating in a study is treatment with intravenous (IV) (through a vein) and/or oral medications (systemic therapy) to help stop the cancer sites from getting larger and the spread of the cancer to additional body sites. Ablative means that the intention of the local treatment is to eliminate the cancer at that metastatic site. The ablative local therapy will consist of very focused, intensive radiotherapy called stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with or without surgical resection and/or microwave ablation, which is a procedure where a needle is temporarily inserted in the tumor and heat is used to destroy the cancer cells. SABR, surgical resection, and microwave ablation have been tested for safety, but it is not scientifically proven that the addition of these treatments are beneficial for your stage of cancer. The addition of ablative local therapy to all known metastatic sites to the usual approach of systemic therapy could shrink or remove the tumor(s) or prevent the tumor(s) from returning.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate and compare overall survival (OS) (measured from time of randomization) in patients with newly diagnosed oligometastatic colorectal cancer (oCRC) treated with total ablative therapy (TAT) in addition to standard of care (SOC) systemic therapy versus SOC systemic therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate and compare event-free survival (EFS) (measured from time of randomization) between the two treatment arms.\n\nII. To assess the adverse events (AE) profile within each of the two treatment arms.\n\nIII. To evaluate the time to local recurrence (TLR) (measured from completion of TAT) in patients with newly diagnosed oCRC treated with TAT + SOC systemic therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM 1: Patients undergo TAT on study, consisting of SABR with or without surgical resection and/or microwave ablation. Patients also receive SOC chemotherapy on study. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans throughout the trial.\n\nARM 2: Patients receive SOC chemotherapy on study. Patients also undergo Patients also undergo CT or MRI or PET/CT scans throughout the trial."
