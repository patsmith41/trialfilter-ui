For people with cancers in the head and neck, doctors often use radiation to target both the tumor and nearby glands. Radiation therapy to this region can affect the blood vessels in the neck that supply blood to the brain. F-18 NaF and F-18 FDG are contrast agents that can be used together with PET/CT imaging to visualize areas inside the body. A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. A CT scan is a procedure that uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-dimensional views of tissues and organs. Combining a PET scan with a CT scan can help make the image easier to interpret. PET/CT scans are hybrid scanners that combine both modalities into a single scan during the same examination. Imaging with F-18 NaF PET/CT may be as effective or more effective than the standard F-18 FDG PET/CT for assessing the effects radiation therapy has on blood vessels in the neck in patients with head and neck cancers.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the role of FDG- and NaF-PET in assessing radiation-induced vascular complications by comparing baseline and follow-up scans in patients with head and neck cancer.\n\nII.
