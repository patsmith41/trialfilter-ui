If radiation therapy is not given, is quality of life better?","detailedDescription":"This study is being done to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for early rectal cancer. The usual approach is defined as care most people get for early rectal cancer.\n\nThe usual approach for patients who are not in a study is surgery to remove the rectum or treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, followed by surgery. There are several chemotherapy drugs approved by Health Canada that are commonly used with radiation therapy. For patients who get the usual approach for this cancer, about 90 out of 100 are free of cancer after 5 years.\n\nIf a patient decides to take part in this study, they will either get a combination of chemotherapy drugs called FOLFOX or CAPOX for up to 12 weeks or will get chemotherapy with radiation therapy for up to 6 weeks.\n\nAfter finishing treatment, and even if treatment is stopped early, the study doctor will watch for side effects and determine which type of surgery would be best. After surgery, patients will be asked to come in every 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for an additional year. Then will be checked every year for 2 years. This means seeing the study doctor for up to 5 years after surgery. Patients may be seen more often if your study doctor thinks it is necessary."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rectal Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":250,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"FOLFOX OR CAPOX","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"FOLFOX= Six cycles of modified FOLFOX consisting of leucovorin, oxaliplatin and bolus fluoruracil (optional), infusional fluorouracil.\n\nCAPOX= Capecitabine twice daily for 14 days and Oxaliplatin on day 1","interventionNames":["Drug: Leucovorin","Drug: Oxaliplatin","Drug: Fluoruracil","Drug: Capecitabine"]},{"label":"ChemoRT","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Standard dose of infusional 5-Fluorouracil/capecitabine and radiation","interventionNames":["Drug: Fluoruracil","Drug: Capecitabine","Radiation: Radiation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Leucovorin","description":"400 mg/m2","armGroupLabels":["FOLFOX OR CAPOX"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Oxaliplatin","description":"85 mg/m2 or 130 mg/m2 on day 1","armGroupLabels":["FOLFOX OR CAPOX"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Fluoruracil","description":"bolus fluoruracil (optional) 400 mg, infusional fluorouracil 2,400 mg/m2","armGroupLabels":["ChemoRT","FOLFOX OR CAPOX"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Capecitabine","description":"1,000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days","armGroupLabels":["ChemoRT","FOLFOX OR CAPOX"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Radiation","description":"54 Gy (27-30 fractions)","armGroupLabels":["ChemoRT"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Clinical response rate upon re-staging","timeFrame":"6 years"},{"measure":"Quality of Life defined using the LARS score","timeFrame":"6 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Total Mesorectal Excision (TME) Free Survival","description":"Defined as time from randomization to the time of TME attempt or performance, local recurrence after complete clinical response (cCR), or death from any cause","timeFrame":"6 years"},{"measure":"Disease Free Survival","description":"Defined as time from randomization to local recurrence/regrowth after cCR that cannot be salvaged with an R0 TM, M1 recurrence, or death","timeFrame":"6 years"},{"measure":"Overall Survival","description":"Among patients treated with induction chemotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy","timeFrame":"6 years"},{"measure":"Rate of downstaging to ypTO/1N0/X","timeFrame":"6 years"},{"measure":"Bowel function assessed by Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) Score","timeFrame":"6 years"},{"measure":"Bladder function assessed by EORTC QLQ-CR29 urinary frequency and urinary incontinence subscales","timeFrame":"6 years"},{"measure":"Other QoL functions assessed by subscales of FIQL","timeFrame":"6 years"},{"measure":"Other QoL functions assessed by subscales of EORTC QLQ-C30","timeFrame":"6 years"},{"measure":"Other QoL functions assessed by subscales of subscales of EORTC QLQ-CR29","timeFrame":"6 years"},{"measure":"Number and severity of adverse events utilizing CTCAE v5.0","timeFrame":"6 years"},{"measure":"Validate the magnetic resonance tumour regression grade (MR-TRG) in patients with T1-T3a rectal cancer","timeFrame":"6 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically confirmed invasive, well-moderately differentiated rectal adenocarcinoma, mismatch repair proficient.\n* MRI stage cT1 not eligible for transanal surgery or cT2-T3a.\n* cN0 stage based on pelvic MRI - including absence of radiographic evidence of mesorectal nodal metastasis, tumour deposits or extramural venous invasion (EMVI).\n* M0 stage based on no evidence of metastatic disease by CT imaging of chest, abdomen and pelvis.\n* Mid to low-lying tumour eligible for transanal excision in the opinion of the treating surgeon.\n* Medically fit to undergo radical TME surgery as per treating surgeon's decision.\n* Participant is able (i.e. sufficiently fluent) and willing to complete the quality of life questionnaires in either English or French or Spanish.\n* Age of at least 18 years.\n* No contraindications to protocol chemotherapy.\n* Adequate normal organ and marrow function: ANC ≥ x 10\\^9/L;
