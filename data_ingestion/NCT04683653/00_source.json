Doctors leading the study will also determine the safest and most tolerable dose of shortened radiation (hypofractionation) used to treat women in this study. Because this study will shorten the radiation course typically used to treat endometrial cancer, each daily treatment given to women in this study will be slightly higher than normal to ensure that the total radiation dose they receive is still effective and similar to the radiation dose they would receive if they were not participating in this study (standard treatment)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Endometrial Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hypofractionated Radiation Treatment (Dose-Finding Arm)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All study participants in this arm will receive hypofractionated whole pelvic radiation treatment for a shortened time period of 3-5 weeks.
